React-based responsive e-commerce page showcasing product layout and design.

This project is a responsive e-commerce page built using React. The focus of this assignment is on UI development.

All components are designed to mimic a real e-commerce site layout.

Placeholder images from the internet are used wherever needed.

Currently, no functional features (like add to cart, search, or checkout) are implemented.

This project demonstrates understanding of React components, JSX, CSS, and responsive design.

Future Scope: Functionalities such as cart management, product filtering, and user authentication will be added gradually.
